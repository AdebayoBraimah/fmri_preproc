Usage
========

Usage menus for each subcommand of ``fmri_preproc``.

.. note:: 

    Should training minimally preprocessed data be needed for training the FIX classifier, then
    the keyword ``preproc_only`` should be included in the settings configuration file and should
    be set to ``True``.

    This option is not accessible from the command line and can only specified in this manner.

    TODO: Come back to this later...

    See `settings <https://fmri-preproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fmri_preproc.utils.html#fmri_preproc.utils.util.settings>`_ for details.
